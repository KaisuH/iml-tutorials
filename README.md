Python tutorial for Intro to Machine Learning at ETH

We recommend you create a virtual environment if you would like to interact with the notebooks. Enviornments are useful tools to help maintain individual package dependencies across several projects. You can do this using `conda` and `pip`:

0. install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or update:
```
conda update conda
```

1. create an enviornment

```
conda create --name iml-python-tutorial python=3.9
```

2. activate it
```
conda activate iml-python-tutorial
```

3. install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can start a notebook server with ```jupyter notebook```
